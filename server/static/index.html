	<h1>Paper-Tracker Downloads</h1>
	<p class="github-explanation">
		All Paper-Tracker downloads are hosted on
		<a href="https://github.com/glidingthroughspace/paper-tracker/releases/latest">Github Releases</a>.
		You can download all necessary files from the "Assets" section for the latest release (the
		download buttons below are links to the files in the latest release). This way, it's easy to get
